# WMATA-Project
Analysis of WMATA Rail Lines
This project conducts an analysis on WMATA's Metro Rail system and its multiple unique rail lines. This project was presented at the NYU Social Impact Research Conference in April 2024.

WMATA: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority
Metro Rail: WMATA's rail system connecting towns across Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia (Washington, D.C.)

Currently the Project Contains Data Analysis for only the Lines of the WMATA however it will be expanded to include analysis of the stations on the WMATA rail system

Check out my website dedicated to the project. Its a work in progress but it will be developed further over time
